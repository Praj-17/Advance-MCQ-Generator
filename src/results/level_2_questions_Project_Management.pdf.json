A need \nreflects the existence of a certain issue that requires an intervention, an issue that must be dealt \nwith.  \nThe need is not, therefore, the current state of affairs, nor the desired, future one. It consists \nexactly in the difference or discrepancy between \u2015what we have\u2016 and \u2015what we wish to have\u2016. \nA needs assessment attempts to identify such gaps, to analyze their nature and causes and to \nestablish priorities for future actions. \nNeeds assessment consists in a set of systematic procedures applied with the aim of setting up \npriorities and making decisions concerning improvement of a program or organization and \nallocation of resources. Priorities are based on the identified needs.  \nA needs assessment is a method of finding out the nature and extent of performance problems \nand how they can be solved (Molenda, Pershing, &Reigeluth, 1996). \nA needs assessment is a process for pinpointing reasons for gaps in performance or a method for \nidentifying new and future performance needs (Gupta, 1999). \nIn general, a needs assessment is a systematic approach to identifying social problems, \ndetermining their extent, and accurately defining the target population to be served and the \nnature of their service needs (Rossi, P. H., Freeman, H. E., & Lipsey, Mark, W. L., 1998). \nA needs assessment is the process of collecting information about an expressed or implied \norganizational need that could be met by conducting training. The need can be a desire to \nimprove current performance or to correct a deficiency. \nA deficiency is a performance that does not meet the current standard. It means that there is a \nprescribed or best way of doing a task and that variance from it is creating a problem. The needs \nassessment process helps the trainer and the person requesting training to specify the training \nneed or performance deficiency. \n",

A need \nreflects the existence of a certain issue that requires an intervention, an issue that must be dealt \nwith.  \nThe need is not, therefore, the current state of affairs, nor the desired, future one. It consists \nexactly in the difference or discrepancy between \u2015what we have\u2016 and \u2015what we wish to have\u2016. \nA needs assessment attempts to identify such gaps, to analyze their nature and causes and to \nestablish priorities for future actions. \nNeeds assessment consists in a set of systematic procedures applied with the aim of setting up \npriorities and making decisions concerning improvement of a program or organization and \nallocation of resources. Priorities are based on the identified needs.  \nA needs assessment is a method of finding out the nature and extent of performance problems \nand how they can be solved (Molenda, Pershing, &Reigeluth, 1996). \nA needs assessment is a process for pinpointing reasons for gaps in performance or a method for \nidentifying new and future performance needs (Gupta, 1999). \nIn general, a needs assessment is a systematic approach to identifying social problems, \ndetermining their extent, and accurately defining the target population to be served and the \nnature of their service needs (Rossi, P. H., Freeman, H. E., & Lipsey, Mark, W. L., 1998). \nA needs assessment is the process of collecting information about an expressed or implied \norganizational need that could be met by conducting training. The need can be a desire to \nimprove current performance or to correct a deficiency. \nA deficiency is a performance that does not meet the current standard. It means that there is a \nprescribed or best way of doing a task and that variance from it is creating a problem. The needs \nassessment process helps the trainer and the person requesting training to specify the training \nneed or performance deficiency. \n",

A useful way of doing this may be to use a logical \nframework (log frame). The process of completing the log frame helps to think through all the \nfactors that should be considered for planning a successful project. Even if people are not \nplanning to develop a log frame, it may help to use the tools included in the log frame approach \nwhen planning projects. \nWhat is a log frame? \nThe log frame is a tool used to help strengthen project design, implementation and evaluation. \nAlthough it is constructed during the planning stage of a project, the log frame is a living \ndocument, which should be consulted and altered throughout the project\u2018s life cycle. The log \nframe is a table of four rows and four columns, where all the key parts of a project can be \ninserted as a clear set of statements: the project goal, purpose, outputs and activities, with their \nindicators, evidence and assumptions. It shows the project\u2018s structure and describes the project \nlogically. The log frame does not show every detail of the project. It is an overview of the key \nfactors.  \nThe Log Frame breaks a project down into four separate and distinct levels of objectives. At the \nlowest level are the Project Inputs. These are the activities to be undertaken that will in turn \nresult in the second level of objectives that we call the Outputs. Outputs are the results that are \ndirectly accomplished by management of the inputs. For example, in an education project, we \ncan produce trained teachers, a constructed and equipped school building and trained \nadministrators. We do this by managing a specific set of inputs (e.g., training of teachers, \nconstruction of school building, etc.). Yet the outputs themselves are not valuable for their own \nsake and are not the justification for the project. What we are really interested in is an \nimprovement in education. This then, represents a higher level objective that we call the \nPurpose. The purpose is what we expect to result from having achieved the outputs. The outputs \n",

Even if people are not \nplanning to develop a log frame, it may help to use the tools included in the log frame approach \nwhen planning projects. \nWhat is a log frame? \nThe log frame is a tool used to help strengthen project design, implementation and evaluation. \nAlthough it is constructed during the planning stage of a project, the log frame is a living \ndocument, which should be consulted and altered throughout the project\u2018s life cycle. The log \nframe is a table of four rows and four columns, where all the key parts of a project can be \ninserted as a clear set of statements: the project goal, purpose, outputs and activities, with their \nindicators, evidence and assumptions. It shows the project\u2018s structure and describes the project \nlogically. The log frame does not show every detail of the project. It is an overview of the key \nfactors.  \nThe Log Frame breaks a project down into four separate and distinct levels of objectives. At the \nlowest level are the Project Inputs. These are the activities to be undertaken that will in turn \nresult in the second level of objectives that we call the Outputs. Outputs are the results that are \ndirectly accomplished by management of the inputs. For example, in an education project, we \ncan produce trained teachers, a constructed and equipped school building and trained \nadministrators. We do this by managing a specific set of inputs (e.g., training of teachers, \nconstruction of school building, etc.). Yet the outputs themselves are not valuable for their own \nsake and are not the justification for the project. What we are really interested in is an \nimprovement in education. This then, represents a higher level objective that we call the \nPurpose. The purpose is what we expect to result from having achieved the outputs. The outputs \n",
