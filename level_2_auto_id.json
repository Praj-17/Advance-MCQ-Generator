A \u2015needs assessment\u2016 will give an overview of community problems. \nA \u2015capacity assessment\u2016 will help identify which problem the project should address.  \nDesign: This involves carrying out further research into the people affected by a problem and \nhow they are affected by it. We also need to consider the risks to the project and how we will \nmeasure the project\u2018s performance.  \nImplementation: During the implementation, it is important to monitor and review the progress \nof the project and any outside changes that affect it. The project plans should be adjusted where \nnecessary.  \nEvaluation: Evaluation should be carried out at or after project completion. Evaluation could be \ncarried out a few months or years after the project has finished in order to assess its long-term \nimpact and sustainability. \nLesson Learning: While the project cycle is a useful way of outlining the stages of a project, it \nhas one drawback: it makes it look as though one tool follows another.
