Project management is a \nprocess of leading a team of capable people in planning and implementing a series of related \nactivities that need to be accomplished on a specific date with a limited budget.  \nProject management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project \nactivities in order to meet or exceed stakeholders\u2018 needs and expectations.  \nSuccessful project management is the art of bringing together the tasks, resources and people \nnecessary to accomplish the business goals and objectives within the specified time constraints \nand within the monetary allowance. Projects and Programs are linked directly to the strategic \ngoals and initiatives of the organization supported. In other words, it provides an organization \nwith powerful tools that improve the organization's ability to plan, organize, implement and \ncontrol its activities and the ways it uses its people and resources. \nA project is a non-repetitive one-of-a-kind activity normally with discrete time, financial and \ntechnical performance goals. Normally a complex effort, usually less than 3 years in duration and \nit is made up of interrelated tasks performed by various organizations. \nThe project management tools and principles provide the means for \n\uf0d8 project breakdown into tasks and sub-tasks \n\uf0d8 finding interdependencies between the tasks \n\uf0d8 allocating resources, human and material and smoothing resources \n\uf0d8 estimation for total project duration and budget \n\uf0d8 monitoring more efficiently project progress \n",

Different types of \nassessments are called needs analysis, such as performance analysis, job/task analysis, target \npopulation analysis, and so forth. Needs assessment often involves the use of more than one type \nof analysis. \nWhy Conduct a Needs Assessment? \nThe main aims of a needs assessment could be:  \n\uf0d8 To assess the extent and causes of community social problems \n\uf0d8 To identify the major beneficiaries and target populations of a project \n\uf0d8 To prioritize problems based on their significance in the community \n\uf0d8 To assess the capacities of the community in the project \n\uf0d8 Offering the needed foundation (information basis) for development or improvement of \nan educational or social program.  \n\uf0d8 Restructuring of an organization for improving the performances in relation with the \nestablished goals.  \n\uf0d8 Setting up criteria for contractic services of human resources training and development \n\uf0d8 Identification of a solution for a complex problem or issue.  \nThe characteristics of a good needs analysis (assessment) are the following: It:  \n\uf0d8 focuses on the results that should be obtained and not on the means for obtaining \nthem;  \n\uf0d8 provides an objective basis for decision-making;  \n\uf0d8 contributes to the establishment of common goals and action areas at organization/ \nproject level;  \n\uf0d8 involves all stakeholders in establishing priorities;  \n\uf0d8 is a cyclic process that integrates within the larger scope of strategic planning \nactivities of an organization or of a community.  \n \n \n",
