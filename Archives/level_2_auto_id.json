A useful way of doing this may be to use a logical \nframework (log frame). The process of completing the log frame helps to think through all the \nfactors that should be considered for planning a successful project. Even if people are not \nplanning to develop a log frame, it may help to use the tools included in the log frame approach \nwhen planning projects. \nWhat is a log frame? \nThe log frame is a tool used to help strengthen project design, implementation and evaluation. \nAlthough it is constructed during the planning stage of a project, the log frame is a living \ndocument, which should be consulted and altered throughout the project\u2018s life cycle. The log \nframe is a table of four rows and four columns, where all the key parts of a project can be \ninserted as a clear set of statements: the project goal, purpose, outputs and activities, with their \nindicators, evidence and assumptions. It shows the project\u2018s structure and describes the project \nlogically. The log frame does not show every detail of the project. It is an overview of the key \nfactors.  \nThe Log Frame breaks a project down into four separate and distinct levels of objectives. At the \nlowest level are the Project Inputs. These are the activities to be undertaken that will in turn \nresult in the second level of objectives that we call the Outputs. Outputs are the results that are \ndirectly accomplished by management of the inputs. For example, in an education project, we \ncan produce trained teachers, a constructed and equipped school building and trained \nadministrators. We do this by managing a specific set of inputs (e.g., training of teachers, \nconstruction of school building, etc.). Yet the outputs themselves are not valuable for their own \nsake and are not the justification for the project. What we are really interested in is an \nimprovement in education. This then, represents a higher level objective that we call the \nPurpose. The purpose is what we expect to result from having achieved the outputs. The outputs \n",

Project Budget \nThe purpose of a project budget is to prepare a valid estimate of the costs associated with the \nperformance of project activities using current assumption. The budget should provide a \ncomplete picture of the project cost structure, including cost estimates for all of the inputs and \nresources needed to implement the project. The project budget should also identify all sources of \nrevenue that will be used to fund program activities including both cash and in-kind \ncontributions. To develop a budget, a project design team should work together with a finance \nspecialist to make realistic estimates for all project expenses. The project budget should be \ndeveloped in the early stages of project design to ensure that the proposed interventions are \nfeasible with the existing and anticipated funding. If the project includes a cost share or leverage \nrequirement, a plan for meeting this requirement shall also be developed and outlined in the \nbudget notes. \n \n \n",
