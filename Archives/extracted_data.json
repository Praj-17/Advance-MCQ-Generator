Projects are the \ntemporary assemblage of key personnel designed to accomplish specific objectives with \nidentifiable customers in mind. A project has a beginning and an end. The project team dissolves \nonce the objectives are met. It is fluid and driven by the specific needs of that business. The \nproject approach to managing activities embraces change and complexity.  \nProjects can be defined in many different ways. However, there are some traits that all projects \nhave in common. Typically, these traits are used to identify what a project is. The most \ndistinguishing feature is a specific time frame. All projects have a beginning and an end. Many \nefforts are called \u2015projects\u2016 but actually become programs as they extend indefinitely and cover \nbroader, less specific business objectives. Projects must have a clear, definitive goal or objective. \nThe objective is specific, identifiable, and can be accomplished. A project usually involves \nvaried activities, which produce quantifiable and qualifiable deliverables that when added \ntogether, accomplish the overall objective.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a temporary process, which has a clearly defined start and end time, a set of \ntasks, and a budget, that is developed to accomplish a well-defined goal or objective\u2016.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a temporary effort of sequential activities designed to accomplish a unique \npurpose.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a group of inter-related activities, constrained by time, cost, and scope, \ndesigned to deliver a unique purpose.  \n\uf0d8 A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service. \nTemporary means that the project has an end date. Unique means that the project\u2018s result \nis different from the results of other functions of the organization.  \n\uf0d8 \u2015An undertaking that encompasses a set of tasks or activities having a definable starting \npoint and well defined objectives. Usually each task has a planned completion data (due \ndate) and assigned resources\u2016.  \n",

Repetition of these steps is necessary to \nestablish the project plan. Typically, several iterations of the planning process are performed \nbefore a plan is actually completed.   \nWhat is a Project Plan?  \nA project plan is a formal, approved document that is used to manage \nand control a project.  \n The project plan forms the basis for all management efforts associated with the project.

Priorities are based on the identified needs.  \nA needs assessment is a method of finding out the nature and extent of performance problems \nand how they can be solved (Molenda, Pershing, &Reigeluth, 1996). \nA needs assessment is a process for pinpointing reasons for gaps in performance or a method for \nidentifying new and future performance needs (Gupta, 1999). \nIn general, a needs assessment is a systematic approach to identifying social problems, \ndetermining their extent, and accurately defining the target population to be served and the \nnature of their service needs (Rossi, P. H., Freeman, H. E., & Lipsey, Mark, W. L., 1998). \nA needs assessment is the process of collecting information about an expressed or implied \norganizational need that could be met by conducting training. The need can be a desire to \nimprove current performance or to correct a deficiency. \nA deficiency is a performance that does not meet the current standard.

SWOT Analysis  \nThe name of this analysis model is actually an English abbreviation: S = strengths; W = \nweaknesses; O = opportunities; T = threats.  \nSWOT analyses have been successfully implemented as methods for organizational analysis, but \nthey can be used at community level as well. Strengths and weaknesses relate to the internal \nenvironment of the analyzed community or organization. They represent inherent characteristics \nconcerning the internal state of affairs.  \nOpportunities and threats relate to the external environment, that is, to what happens outside the \norganization or community, but which has an impact on the good running of activities. The \ncontext can either favor or hinder the implementation of activities within an organization or \ncommunity.  \nProject teams should focus on maximizing opportunities and limiting the impact of threats, as \nwell as on enhancing strengths and improving the weaknesses. \nEXAMPLE:  \nIn our example one technological high-school from the center of the commune has generous \nspaces, but in two separate buildings: one is very old and includes the workshops and the other is \nmore recent, but has roof problems. The school has 420 pupils enrolled, and the birth rate in the \ncommune and in the area where pupils are recruited from is constant, even slightly increasing. \nMost teachers come from the locality.

More than 70% of the teachers have not \nparticipated at a training course for more than 3 years, due to the poor offer and to the long \ndistance from the city where the training providers organize this sort of activities.  \nWe can identify then strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the school in \nthis specific case.  \nStrengths:  \n\uf0d8 good collaboration at the managerial team level;  \n\uf0d8 high percentage of qualified and non-commuter teaching staff;  \n\uf0d8 generous spaces.  \nWeaknesses:  \n\uf0d8 poor material base; and aged teachers;  \n\uf0d8 problems with the quality of the buildings;  \n\uf0d8 reluctant attitude towards commuters.  \nOpportunities:  \n\uf0d8 slightly increasing birth rate;  \n\uf0d8 parents\u2018 availability to get involved and their good economical status;  \n\uf0d8 the two investment projects.  \nThreats:  \n\uf0d8 distant relationship with the local public authority;  \n\uf0d8 poor training courses offer for the teachers in the school;  \n\uf0d8 great distance from the county to municipal city (Teacher Training House).  \nKeep in Mind:  \nStrengths and weaknesses refer to school and to what happens with it.  \nOpportunities and risks refer to the external environment, to what happens outside the school \nand the community, but affects a good performance.

The Economic Aspect concerns the resources available at the analysed level (national, \nregional or local): if there is economic recession or recovery, what economic activities represent \na priority and the resources they can provide to the project, the average level of income etc.  \nc. The Social Aspect concerns the existence of social issues (such as unemployment, poverty, \ncrime etc.) and the way they are dealt with at national, regional and local level, as well as the \nposition of different stakeholders towards the development project. \nd. The Technological Aspect concerns the technological level of the social project. For instance: \nwhen we analyze an educational project; whether there is educational television in the area; \nwhether there are resources for distance education and training; whether there are enough \nproperly equipped training facilities, the number of families in the area having television, the \nnumber of TV channels broadcast, the number of families having a PC and how many of these \nhave Internet connection etc. \ne. The Environmental Aspect concerns the analysis of environmental issues in which the \norganization or the community operates. \nCapacity Assessment \nCommunities should be encouraged to use their own capacities and resources to address the \nproblems they face. It is therefore important to carry out a capacity assessment after needs \nassessment to identify strengths that the community could use to address the problems they \nidentified earlier. The project, if needed, should focus on strengthening the community\u2018s \ncapacities to address their problems.

Remember to ask a range of community members, as \ndifferent people have different perspectives. \nWrite the capacities onto a large piece of paper and ask community members to identify how \nthey could be used to address the problems identified during the needs assessment.

    "20": "Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n20 \n \n\u25a0 Primary Stakeholders who benefit from, or are adversely affected by, an activity. This term \ndescribes people whose well-being may be dependent on a resource or service or area (e.g. a \nforest) that the project addresses. Usually they live in the area or very near there sources in \nquestion. They often have few options when faced with change, so they have difficulty adapting. \nPrimary stakeholders are usually vulnerable.

The method provided below is just \none approach. The approach taken will vary depending on the type of project that is being \nproposed. For example, for an advocacy project we would need to consider different aspects of \n",
    "21": "Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n21 \n \nstakeholders than we would for a development project. The method given below is quite general \nand can be adapted to whatever type of project is being proposed. \nIdeally, stakeholder analysis should be carried out with representatives of as many stakeholder \ngroups as possible. It might not always be practical to do so if the stakeholders are widely \nspread. However, if there is a danger that important stakeholders might be excluded, more time \nand resources should be invested in doing the stakeholder analysis to make sure they are \nincluded. \n3.2. Problem Analysis \nBefore we can start to design the project, we need to analyse the problem identified during \nproject identification. Problem analysis helps primary stakeholders to identify the causes and \neffects of the problems they face. It involves drawing a problem tree, from which project \nobjectives can be identified. Use the stakeholder analysis to identify those who should help to \nconstruct the problem tree, making sure there is a mix of people from the community with local \nknowledge, technical knowledge and so on. Problem analysis can be carried out with different \nstakeholder groups in order to see how their perspectives vary. \nTo help stakeholders think through all the causes and effects, check that they have considered \nsocial, environmental, political, economic and technical factors. The problem tree should help to \nreinforce our findings during the research phase of the planning. It might also raise new issues \nthat we had not previously considered. \nAfter the needs assessment is completed, the collected information is analyzed and interpreted to \ndetermine causes and consequences of identified problems and link them in a cause-effect \nrelationship. The better the problem is understood, the better a project can be designed to address \nit. A problem analysis technique is used to interpret the data and identify causes and effects. \nWhat are problems, causes and consequences? \nA problem is a specific negative situation related to a person or group\u2018s well-being. For example, \na high pregnancy rate among teenage girls and an increased rate of HIV/AIDS among young \npeople are problems. \n",
    "22": "Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n22 \n \nCauses are factors that exist in the households, community, organizations, and countries that \nhave initiated or perpetuated the problem. Causes can be analyzed in the context of behavior, \nconditions, knowledge, attitude and practices. \nThere are two levels of causes: underlying causes and root-causes. \n\u2022 Underlying causes are those that are most visible and recalled first in the process of problem \nanalysis. Underlying causes can be considered in multiple dimensions of cause and effect. For \nexample, when inspecting the underlying causes for increased pregnancy rate among teenage \ngirls, a conclusion could be drawn that girls do not use contraceptives. The underlying cause for \nthis fact could be that they do not have access to contraceptives, or that they have never been \neducated on how to use contraceptives. Underlying causes can be explored by continuing to ask \n\u2015why\u2016 until the root-cause is identified. \n\u2022 Root-causes are identified by analyzing the problem to its core. Root-causes are those that give \nthe last possible explanation of the existing problem. For example, the root-cause for high \npregnancy rates among teenage girls in a certain country could be strong cultural norms viewing \nsexuality as a taboo. The root cause is often entrenched in cultural norms, and can be difficult to \naddress. In this case, the focus of problem-solving should concentrate on underlying causes. \nConsequences are social, environmental, political or economic conditions that result from the \nproblem. For example, some consequences of a high pregnancy rate among teenage girls are \nincreased maternal morbidity and mortality rates, an increased rate of school drop outs, or \nincreased unemployment among young people. \nHow do you conduct a problem analysis? \nOne way to think about logical steps in identifying causes of a problem is to ask the question \n\u2015why?\u2016 In answering this question, a project design team will be moving down the logical \nstructure towards the underlying cause. Most likely there will be more than one underlying \ncause. When there is point at which it is difficult to find new answers, it means that most of the \nunderlying and root causes have been identified and it is time to begin designing the project. The \n\u2015why\u2016 method is easy to use and can be understood by any community group. \nPROBLEM TREES Problem Trees are used to help analyze a situation and identify a core \nproblem that you want to focus on.

A useful way of doing this may be to use a logical \nframework (log frame). The process of completing the log frame helps to think through all the \nfactors that should be considered for planning a successful project. Even if people are not \nplanning to develop a log frame, it may help to use the tools included in the log frame approach \nwhen planning projects. \nWhat is a log frame? \nThe log frame is a tool used to help strengthen project design, implementation and evaluation. \nAlthough it is constructed during the planning stage of a project, the log frame is a living \ndocument, which should be consulted and altered throughout the project\u2018s life cycle. The log \nframe is a table of four rows and four columns, where all the key parts of a project can be \ninserted as a clear set of statements: the project goal, purpose, outputs and activities, with their \nindicators, evidence and assumptions. It shows the project\u2018s structure and describes the project \nlogically. The log frame does not show every detail of the project. It is an overview of the key \nfactors.  \nThe Log Frame breaks a project down into four separate and distinct levels of objectives. At the \nlowest level are the Project Inputs. These are the activities to be undertaken that will in turn \nresult in the second level of objectives that we call the Outputs. Outputs are the results that are \ndirectly accomplished by management of the inputs. For example, in an education project, we \ncan produce trained teachers, a constructed and equipped school building and trained \nadministrators. We do this by managing a specific set of inputs (e.g., training of teachers, \nconstruction of school building, etc.). Yet the outputs themselves are not valuable for their own \nsake and are not the justification for the project. What we are really interested in is an \nimprovement in education. This then, represents a higher level objective that we call the \nPurpose. The purpose is what we expect to result from having achieved the outputs. The outputs \n",
    "30": "Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n30 \n \nare a set of interrelated objectives that, combined, are aimed at achieving the project purpose. \nWithin the project itself we have, therefore, three levels: Inputs, Outputs and Purpose.  \nThe fourth level in the Logical Framework is a higher order objective called the Goal. The \nproject is one of the necessary conditions for achieving this goal, but will not be sufficient by \nitself to achieve the goal. Using the same example of an education project, the specific project \npurpose is improved education and the goal is manpower needs for local industry met. In order to \nachieve this goal, other projects also may have to be undertaken, such as one to motivate those \nwith the required skills to work in the region in which their skills are needed. Just as we must \nidentify all the outputs necessary to achieve the purpose, so we must identify all the purposes \n(projects) necessary to achieve the goal. The goal is usually associated with specific program or \nsector objectives. \nDetails can be given in other documents, such as the proposal, budget and activity schedule, \nwhich accompany the log frame. \nLog frame \n \nSummary  \n \nIndicators  \n \nEvidence  \n \nAssumptions \nGoal \n \n \n \n \nPurpose \n \n \n \n \nOutputs \n \n \n \n \nActivities \n \n \n \n \n \nMost donors use the log frame format above.

Having carried out a stakeholder analysis and done research, we can \nanswer the question, \u2017Where are we now?\u2018 \nThe log frame asks a series of further questions: \n\uf0d8 Where do we want to be?

This helps them to \ncommunicate their plan simply with others, although a log frame is no substitute for \nwriting a full plan. \nHowever, the log frame approach does have limitations: \n\uf076 Project management can become rigid unless the log frame is continually checked and \nadjusted. \n\uf076 As the approach involves participation by a number of different stakeholders, good \nleadership and facilitation skills are needed to ensure stakeholders understand the \napproach and actively participate in it. \n\uf076 Since the approach builds on analysis of a problem, it might not be viewed as appropriate \nin cultures where people do not openly discuss problems. \n\uf076 The terminology used can be threatening to some stakeholders. The approach itself can \nbe very difficult to understand in some cultures. \nWho should complete the log frame? \nWhere possible, the primary stakeholders should be involved in developing the log frame. It \nshould be developed by the people most closely involved in project implementation. It is \npossible that the concept of the log frame will not be easily understood by primary stakeholders. \nHowever, as the process is as important as the end product, participatory processes could be used \nto guide stakeholders through the questions and help them to identify some of the project \ncomponents.

For example, we can control \ngetting up on time, having breakfast and getting to the bus-stop for ourselves. We cannot control \nthe traffic or ensure that the bus company keeps its buses in good running order. So by \nidentifying our assumptions, we have expanded our original hypothesis statement to include the \nspecific nature of the more important uncertainties that could affect that hypothesis. \nHaving once identified the assumptions, we can then try to deal with them in such a way as to \nincrease our probability of success and consequently our confidence in our project design. In the \ncase of the bus example, we can get up earlier to avoid traffic delays or we could call the bus \ncompany and find out how often their buses break down. If the answer is 80% of the time, we \nmight decide to rent a car!  \nAssumptions are useful not only during the design stage of the project but also during the course \nof the project and its evaluation. Once the project begins, the project manager should monitor the \nassumptions regularly to assess their continuing validity. If he finds that an assumption proves to \nbe invalid, he must take action to rectify the situation. A good project manager monitors \nassumptions regularly so that corrective action can be taken in a timely manner. Assumptions are \nalso important during an evaluation because their examination can provide insight as to why the \nproject has or has not succeeded in achieving its objectives.  \nTo develop useful assumption statements, we ask the question: \u2015What could happen to make this \nassumption invalid?\u2016 For example, if we have a very general assumption such as \u2015equipment \navailable on time\u2016, we would ask: \u2015What could happen to delay the availability of equipment?\u2016 \nThe response might be that there is a likelihood that a dock strike will occur and thus we realize \nwe are really making the underlying assumption that the dock strike would not occur. We can \nthen follow this with a further question: \u2015What could happen to make the dock strike occur?\u2016 \nSuppose we find that the government is scheduled to sign a contract with the dock workers\u2018 \nunion two weeks before the project equipment is due to arrive at the port, and there is a \n",
    "36": "Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n36 \n \npossibility that the government will not accept the union\u2018s demands. Project staff could check \nwith the union and with the appropriate government officials to determine the probability that the \ncontract will be signed on time. If the probability appears high, instead of the original \nassumption (\u2015equipment available on time\u2016), the following assumption would be made: \n\u2015Government and dock workers\u2018 union sign labor contract by June 28, 1982 in time for delivery \nof equipment\u2016. The project manager will know then to keep an eye on negotiations between the \ngovernment and the dock workers and, if it looks like the contract may not be signed, he can \nreplan the project accordingly.  \nMost projects fail, not because of bad project design, but because of lack of attention to these \nfactors that are either outside the control of the project or which are too difficult or costly to \ncontrol. In the log frame we need to show that we have thought about what these factors might \nbe. To complete the assumptions column of the log frame, first consider the risks linked to the \nproject \nRisk assessment  \nRisk is the potential for unwanted happenings. Every activity involves risks. If they happen, \nsome risks will affect the activity more than others. Risk assessment helps to identify them and \nconsider the likelihood of them happening and their likely impact. The risks can then be \nmanaged by changing the project plans to ensure the risks are minimized. \nPossible risks include: \n\uf0d8 climatic \u2013 rainfall \n\uf0d8 human \u2013 labor strikes, beneficiaries unwilling to try new techniques, project staff leaving \nthe organization \n\uf0d8 economic \u2013 crop prices being unstable \n\uf0d8 political \u2013 government policies \n\uf0d8 projects by other agencies not remaining on schedule. \nThe \u2018If-and-Then\u2019 test \nFor each objective in the log frame, consider what assumptions need to be made in order for that \nobjective to lead to the objective at the next level.  \n \n \n",

They answer the question \n\u2017How do we know whether or not what we planned is happening, or has happened?\u2018 Indicators \nhelp us to monitor, review and evaluate the project. They enable us to know whether the project \nplans need adjusting. They help us to learn lessons from a project in order to avoid making the \nsame mistakes in other projects. \nLog frames sometimes call indicators \u2017Objectively Verifiable Indicators\u2018. The term \u2017objectively\u2018 \nis used because indicators should not depend on the point of view of the person measuring them. \nIt should not matter who measures them \u2013 the same result should be reached. So it is better to ask \ntwo people to measure attendance at a meeting by counting the number of people there, than to \nask them to grade attendance on a scale of very poor, poor, adequate, good or very good. One \nperson might think attendance is very good while another might think it is only adequate. This \nwould depend on their past experience of meetings and their own expectations of how many \npeople might attend this one. \nTypes of Indicators \nThere are many different types of indicators to consider. Try to be creative and use a mixture in \norder to ensure that the objectives can be measured effectively and that monitoring and \nevaluation needs can be met. \n",
    "38": "Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n38 \n \nFormative indicators (also called Milestones) are used during an activity, phase or project to \nshow whether progress is on track. \nSummative indicators are used at the end of the project for evaluation. \nDirect indicators measure the objective directly, such as the number of children attending \nschool. \nIndirect indicators (also called Proxy indicators) are used if direct indicators are not appropriate \nor possible if, for example:  \n\uf0fc results cannot be measured directly, such as quality of life \n\uf0fc direct indicators are too expensive to measure \n\uf0fc direct indicators can only be measured after the project has ended. \nFor example, to measure an increase in literacy it might be difficult or costly to interview \nchildren, but the number of books borrowed from the school library might give you an indication \nof whether or not literacy has increased. \nIt can be very difficult to measure people\u2018s incomes without offending them. Instead, we could \nlook at changes in household expenditure. This might involve choosing a list of items that a \nhousehold might have, including a few luxury items, and see how expenditure changes over \ntime. We could also look at sales figures of local shops and services as these are likely to be \naffected by changes in the incomes of the local population. \nIt is easier to measure behavior than feelings because behavior can be observed. So if we want to \nmeasure whether people feel more confident, we could observe how often they speak in \ncommunity meetings. \nQuantitative indicators can be analyzed in numerical form \u2013 who, what, when, where, how \nmuch, how many, how often? This might include: \n\uf0d8 how often things happen \n\uf0d8 number of people involved or affected \n\uf0d8 growth rates \n\uf0d8 uptake, for example, school enrolment, visits to clinic, adoption of new seed varieties. \nQualitative indicators measure things that cannot be counted, like: \n\uf0d8 satisfaction, opinions \n\uf0d8 decision-making ability \n\uf0d8 changes in attitude. \n",
    "39": "Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n39 \n \nTry to use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative indicators so that we can be sure to capture \nthe real progress and impact of the project. \nImagination is very important when setting indicators. It can help to ask a group of stakeholders \nsetting indicators to close their eyes and imagine how the situation will be improved by the end \nof the project. What do they hear, see, touch, feel and smell that will be different when the main \nproblem has been addressed? If we are aiming for holistic development, then our impact on \nspiritual well-being should be as great as that on physical well-being. Spiritual indicators are \nparticularly difficult to set. Indirect indicators might have to be used. \nExamples of basic indicators include;  \nEconomic; yield per hectare, production per laborer, eggs per day, production of handicraft \nitems per month, average income, land area per household, cattle per household, percentage of \npeople with bank accounts, percentage of people above or below the poverty line, percentage of \npeople without land, rate of migration. \nSocial; Infant mortality rate, number of deaths, literacy rate, average years in formal schooling, \nnumber of students entering secondary education, difference between male and female wages, \npercentage of women receiving training, percentage of people attending meetings, representation \nof disadvantaged groups on committees. \nEnvironmental; Fish harvested per year, length of fallow, forest cleared each year, water \navailability in soil, erosion, percentage of households practicing composting, average time to \ncollect fuel wood each day. \nSpiritual; Crime rate, divorce rate, church membership, attendance at church meetings. \nSetting good Indicators \nIndicators should be: \n\uf076 Relevant; is the indicator relevant to the objective it is measuring?

This could involve referring back to the problem tree. The effects in the problem tree \ncan be turned into indicators. \n\uf0d8 If there is a long list of possible indicators for one particular objective, try to reduce the \nlist so that only the essential ones are included.

Some of the indicators might need to be changed during the project if they are \ninadequate or too difficult or expensive to measure. \nGoal level Indicators; Since the project contributes towards the goal but cannot be wholly \nresponsible for achieving the goal, the indicators at goal level may reach beyond the end of the \nproject. They might not be measured by our organization, but be included in government \nstatistics some months after the project has ended. Of course, one problem of using such an \nindicator is that it will not tell us how much of the progress is due to our project and how much \nof it is a result of projects by other organizations. As much as possible, goal level indicators \nshould measure change during the lifetime of the project. \n",
    "41": "Project Planning and Management: Dilla University \n41 \n \nPurpose level Indicators; indicators can be difficult to identify at purpose level.

The output indicators can be transferred to \nthe terms of reference for the member of staff or consultant that is responsible for delivering the \noutputs. \nActivity Indicators; the indicators at activity level usually include a summary of the inputs or \nbudget.
