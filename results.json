Project management is a \nprocess of leading a team of capable people in planning and implementing a series of related \nactivities that need to be accomplished on a specific date with a limited budget.  \nProject management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project \nactivities in order to meet or exceed stakeholders\u2018 needs and expectations.  \nSuccessful project management is the art of bringing together the tasks, resources and people \nnecessary to accomplish the business goals and objectives within the specified time constraints \nand within the monetary allowance. Projects and Programs are linked directly to the strategic \ngoals and initiatives of the organization supported. In other words, it provides an organization \nwith powerful tools that improve the organization's ability to plan, organize, implement and \ncontrol its activities and the ways it uses its people and resources. \nA project is a non-repetitive one-of-a-kind activity normally with discrete time, financial and \ntechnical performance goals. Normally a complex effort, usually less than 3 years in duration and \nit is made up of interrelated tasks performed by various organizations. \nThe project management tools and principles provide the means for \n\uf0d8 project breakdown into tasks and sub-tasks \n\uf0d8 finding interdependencies between the tasks \n\uf0d8 allocating resources, human and material and smoothing resources \n\uf0d8 estimation for total project duration and budget \n\uf0d8 monitoring more efficiently project progress \n"
